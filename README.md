# DH140 Final Project

## Diversity in Beauty: Shade Ranges
This project looks into cosmetic companies and their most popular liquid foundation line shade ranges. The data explores and analyzes the characteristics of these shade ranges to learn more about shade availability from beauty brands in the US and around the world. Here, the project seeks to investigate the diversity and inclusion (or lack of) in foundation products.

### Research Question:
*How inclusive and diverse are beauty brands around the world?*: The limited foundation shade ranges

## Brainstorming Ideas
#### Data and Visualization of Interest
The following article relates to data science and a humanities topic that I am interested in:

["Fashionable Data" by Miya Oshiro](https://medium.com/visumd/analyzing-fashion-data-street-to-designer-fashion-visualization-b1f936f66548)

Fashion is an interesting historical document that is simiplified to articles of fabric we put on our backs. However, fashion can reveal a multitude aspects of society at the time, ranging from social values of gender and class expectations to the political and economical environment.

Not only does the visualization organize almost 4,000 fashion show images around the world through color palettes, but it also allows users to upload their own pictures of anything to discover how past designers how utilized a similar color palette in their line.

#### Ideas for Data to Investigate
The following are concepts I am interested in investigating:

1. Interested Humanities Topics
* Music
* Fashion
* Social Media

2. Stats & Modeling: Making recommendations, predictions, and arguments; This topic seems the most appealing to me because it would be interesting to see the behavior patterns of humans that have led to the formation of the basis of these recommendations, predictions, etc.

#### Ideas from Curated Datasets and Project Lists
The following are possible topics to look into pertaining to a specific curated dataset:

| Dataset of Interest | Description | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Buzz in Social Media | Significant events on Twitter and Tom's Hardware (a more conservative forum network); Look into the difference between political alignments and news information that circulate/being searched for | https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Buzz+in+social+media+ |
| Newspaper and Magazine Images Segmentation | Classification on regions of documents with text, picture, and background areas; Look to see advertising patterns/formats that are most attention drawing | https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Newspaper+and+magazine+images+segmentation+dataset# |
